**NOTE**

1. Sorry, We no longer accept fetch adapter for new projects, we prefer the tvl to computed from blockchain data, if you have trouble with creating a the adapter, please hop onto our discord, we are happy to assist you.
2. The protocol is usually listed within 24 hours of merging the PR
3. Please fill the form below  **only if the PR is for listing a new protocol** else it can be ignored/replaced with reason/details about the PR
4. **For updating listing info** It is a different repo, you can find your listing in this file: https://github.com/DefiLlama/defillama-server/blob/master/defi/src/protocols/data2.ts, you can  edit it there and put up a PR
5. Do not edit/push `package-lock.json` file as part of your changes, we use lockfileVersion 2, and most use v1 and using that messes up our CI
6. No need to go to our discord and announce that you've created a PR, we monitor all PRs and will review it asap

##### Short Description (to be shown on DefiLlama):
The Animal Farm
Our vision is to make traditional finance tools, typically only reserved for the super wealthy, available to the anyone by using decentralized protocols which are not limited by the gatekeeping of centralized institutions. All of our products utilize trustless models that allow users to take full ownership of their personal finances. Lending and yield aggregating is the main focus of Animal Farm, but unlike other platforms Animal Farm is the only true decentralized ownership lending and yield aggregating platform.

This means taxes and fees which would typically go to administrators instead go to you, the participants of the platform through use of our innovative governance ownership structure which pays out dividends in both BUSD and BNB. This provides a unique opportunity for our users to profit as the super wealthy do, by accumulating ownership of assets and earning yield on then in the form of dividends.
